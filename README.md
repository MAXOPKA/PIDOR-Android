# PIDOR-Android
This is an example implementation of an AppPride's iOS application architecture for android.
## What PIDOR means:
**P** - *Presenter*, just conventional presenter, like it's prototype in MVP architecture

**I** - *Interactor*, another conventional thing, the same as Interactor in "Clean architecture" or in VIPER

**D** - *Decorator*, basically it is a View

**O** - *object*, an Entity.

**R** - *router* - an object which doing all the navigation between modules.


This architecture can be named as PIVER(or may be a VIPER, another flavour of it), but this is a port of an existing thing, so i have no freedom here.

*For CIS countries folks: Yep, I know it sounds really bad in languages related to Russian, let's imply it's just a joke. Call it PIVER, if you would like to do so.*
